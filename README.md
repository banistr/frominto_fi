# frominto

Finnish language is hard. We come from "M채ntyharju**lta**" or "Hiekkaharju**sta**".
We spend our time "Lahde**ssa**" or "Kes채lahde**lla**". This is a library to solve the difficulties with the conjugations!

## Usage

```javascript
import frominto from 'frominto'

frominto('Helsinki')

// Would return:

{
 "from": "Helsingist채",
 "in": "Helsingiss채",
 "to": "Helsinkiin"
}

frominto('Kauniainen')
frominto('Tampere')
```
